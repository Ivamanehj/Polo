          <br>After locating the desired shot and firmly grasping the cue with the dominant hand, the player should proceed to lower their body towards the table, positioning themselves to face the direction of the cue ball. Being stiff and upright hinders one's ability to make a shot. They should maintain a relaxed, slightly bent posture with their legs at least a few inches apart. 
        Cradle or bridge the cue’s tip with the other hand On the other hand, the position has a significant impact on their shot. A bridge will need to be made for the cue using the less dominant hand. Using the hand as an anchor is a technique that helps maintain a solid shot. To achieve a top-notch shot, they must master the art of gripping the cue stick in a manner that balances freedom of movement with a solid foundation. Building a good bridge requires a significant amount of talent. It is important to know finger placement and hand positioning. Having a decent bridge allows for better concentration when striking the cue ball with the right amount of power. 
          <br>There are various techniques available for creating a bridge with fingers, and it is important to familiarize themselves with each technique as they serve specific purposes in the game of pool.
