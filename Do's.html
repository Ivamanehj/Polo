        1. Respect your opponent's turn: Taking turns is an important component of playing billiards. It is critical to wait patiently for your opponent to complete their shot before reaching the table. Rushing them can disrupt their concentration and create a negative environment. 
        <br>2. Stay quiet and focused: Billiards requires attention. Maintain reasonable noise levels and avoid engaging in loud talk or disruptive conduct while others are playing. Also, be aware of your body language, avoiding exaggerated motions or movements that could distract your opponent.

      3. set up the balls in the rack: When it's your turn to arrange the balls, make sure they are tightly packed. A tight rack is important to avoid any gaps that could impact the break and the overall flow of the game.
      <br>4. shots and accept evident fouls: When playing 8-ball or 9-ball, make it a point to explicitly announce which ball and pocket you plan to sink. This not only clarifies the game, but also exemplifies excellent 
      sportsmanship. Furthermore, if you commit an evident foul, such as a double hit or accidently touching a ball with your clothing, accept it immediately and let your opponent take control of the table. 
     <br>5. Extend a handshake and display sportsmanship: Prior to and following the game, offer a handshake to your opponent. This simple act showcases good sportsmanship and respect, regardless of the outcome of the game.
