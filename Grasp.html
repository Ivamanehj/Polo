        <p>For optimal pool stick grip, it is recommended to position the cue near the waist and hold it with a relaxed hand. 
          When handling the column, gently hold it at the waist and grip the back end of the stick with a comfortable hand. 
          Make sure to inspect the back for any tape to ensure that the hand position is correctly placed. 
          Gently shift your hand towards the back of the tape in this location. 
          It is recommended to have a gap of at least 4 or 5 inches between the tapes. 
          Players can determine if the cue is being held correctly by observing the hand form at a 90° angle. 
          Players should be aware of some essential gripping tips, as stated below: 
          <br>● Proper grip: The player needs to have a comfortable and precise grip. It is a common misconception that 
          <br>individuals often struggle with the proper grip of a pool cue, resulting in an overly tight hold. 
          <br>● Correct posture: Align the cue ball and the body. This will help ensure precise shot placement. 
          <br>● Accurate hand position: Grip the stick with the thumb and index finger, and incorporate the middle finger for added strength.
